        The robonext workshop is a 6-week workshop that is divided into two
        parts: six parts of theory and two parts of practical implementation.
        The concepts are taught by members of the TRF, and guest lectures are
        delivered for some topics, with speakers including past team members and
        qualified professors.

        Using the toolkits provided to them, the participants build a “Pick and
        Place” robot that runs on a wired network, and then after a two weeks of
        theory based on android development and Wi-Fi-related conceptual
        frameworks, the robot is transitioned into a fully automated robot that
        can be controlled via a mobile application.

        Netra is the Android Application that TRF uses for Robonext Workshop.The
        netra is an open source application which was built using kotlin, xml
        and is connected with the google assistant for voice commands . Netra
        has four features with which we can control the robot. The features
        included in the app are Face Follower, Manual Control, OCR + Distance
        and lastly, Voice Control on a specific keyword let’s say "TRF" via
        Bluetooth.
